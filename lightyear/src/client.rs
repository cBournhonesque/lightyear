/// - [`ClientEventsPlugin`]: Adds the client network event
/// - [`ClientNetworkingPlugin`]: Handles the network state (connecting/disconnecting the client, sending/receiving packets)
/// - [`ClientDiagnosticsPlugin`]: Computes diagnostics about the client connection. Can be disabled if you don't need it.
/// - [`ClientReplicationReceivePlugin`]: Handles the replication of entities and resources from server to client. This can be
///   disabled if you don't need server to client replication.
/// - [`ClientReplicationSendPlugin`]: Handles the replication of entities and resources from client to server. This can be
///   disabled if you don't need client to server replication.
/// - [`PredictionPlugin`]: Handles the client-prediction systems. This can be disabled if you don't need it.
/// - [`InterpolationPlugin`]: Handles the interpolation systems. This can be disabled if you don't need it.
