/*!
The Protocol is used to define all the types that can be sent over the network

A protocol is composed of a few main parts:
- a [`MessageRegistry`](message::MessageRegistry) that contains the list of all the messages that can be sent over the network, along with how to serialize and deserialize them
- a [`ComponentRegistry`](component::ComponentRegistry) that contains the list of all the components that can be sent over the network, along with how to serialize and deserialize them.
  You can also define additional behaviour for each component (such as how to run interpolation for them, etc.)
- a list of inputs that can be sent from client to server
- a [`ChannelRegistry`](channel::ChannelRegistry) that contains the list of channels that define how the data will be sent over the network (reliability, ordering, etc.)
