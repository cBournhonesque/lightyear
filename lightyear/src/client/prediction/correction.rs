//! This module provides the ability to smooth the rollback (from the Predicted state to the Corrected state) over a certain amount of ticks, instead
//! of just snapping back instantly to the Corrected state

// maybe multiple correction_modes:
// - instant (default)
// - interpolate (provided)
// - custom
