/// Component added to client-side entities that are predicted.

/// Prediction allows the client to simulate the game state locally without waiting for server confirmation,
/// reducing perceived latency. This component links the predicted entity to its server-confirmed counterpart.
///
/// When an entity is marked as `Predicted`, the `PredictionPlugin` will:
/// - Store its component history.
/// - Rollback and re-simulate the entity when a server correction is received.
/// - Manage the relationship between the predicted entity and its corresponding confirmed entity received from the server.
// NOTE: we create Predicted here because it is used by multiple crates (prediction, replication)
