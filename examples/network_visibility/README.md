# Interest management

A simple example that shows how to use Lightyear to perform interest management.

Interest management is a technique to reduce the amount of data that is sent to each client:
we want to send only the data that is relevant to each client.

In this example, we are going to replicate entities that are within a certain distance of the client.

## Running an example

- Run the server with a gui: `cargo run -- server`
- Run client with id 1: `cargo run -- client -c 1`

[//]: # (- Run the client and server in two separate bevy Apps: `cargo run` or `cargo run separate`)
- Run the server without a gui: `cargo run --no-default-features --features=server -- server`
- Run the client and server in "HostClient" mode, where the client also acts as server (both are in the same App) : `cargo run -- host-client -c 0`

You can control the behaviour of the example by changing the list of features. By default, all features are enabled (client, server, gui).
For example you can run the server in headless mode (without gui) by running `cargo run --no-default-features --features=server,udp,netcode`.

### Testing in wasm with webtransport

NOTE: I am using the [bevy cli](https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_cli) to build and serve the wasm example.

To test the example in wasm, you can run the following commands: `bevy run web`

You will need a valid SSL certificate to test the example in wasm using webtransport. You will need to run the following
commands to generate a self-signed certificate:
- `cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" && sh certificates/generate.sh` (to generate the temporary SSL
  certificates, they are only valid for 2 weeks)
