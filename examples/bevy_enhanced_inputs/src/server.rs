//! The server side of the example.
//! It is possible (and recommended) to run the server in headless mode (without any rendering plugins).
//!
//! The server will:
//! - spawn a new player entity for each client that connects
//! - read inputs from the clients and move the player entities accordingly
//!
//! Lightyear will handle the replication of entities automatically if you add a `Replicate` component to them.
