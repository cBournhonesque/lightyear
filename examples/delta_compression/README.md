# Delta compression

An example that shows how to enable delta-compression when replicating components.

In this example, instead of sending the updated `PlayerPosition` as a Vec2 (8 bytes), we only send 
the delta between the previous and the new position (2 bytes). This is done by implementing the
`Diffable` trait for the `PlayerPosition` component.

Delta compression can also be useful if you have a component that contains a large amount of data
(for example a Vec of 1000 elements) and you only need to update a few elements.


## Running the example

- Run the server with a gui: `cargo run server`
- Run client with id 1: `cargo run client -c 1`
- Run client with id 2: `cargo run client -c 2`
- Run the client and server in two separate bevy Apps: `cargo run` or `cargo run separate`
- Run the server without a gui: `cargo run --no-default-features --features=server`
- Run the client and server in "HostServer" mode, where the server is also a client (there is only one App): `cargo run host-server`

You can control the behaviour of the example by changing the list of features. By default, all features are enabled (client, server, gui).
For example you can run the server in headless mode (without gui) by running `cargo run --no-default-features --features=server`.
You can modify the file `assets/settings.ron` to modify some networking settings.

### Testing in wasm with webtransport

NOTE: I am using [trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/) to build and serve the wasm example.

You will need a valid SSL certificate to test the example in wasm using webtransport. You will need to run the following
commands:
- `cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" && sh examples/certificates/generate.sh` (to generate the temporary SSL
  certificates, they are only valid for 2 weeks)
- Start the server with: `cargo run -- server`
- Then start the wasm client wasm with ``RUSTFLAGS='--cfg getrandom_backend="wasm_js"' trunk server --features=client``
