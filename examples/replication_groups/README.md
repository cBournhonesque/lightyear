# Replication groups

This is an example that shows how to make Lightyear replicate multiple entities in a single message,
to make sure that they are always in a consistent state (i.e. that entities in a group are all replicated on the same tick).

Without a replication group, it is possible that one entity is replicated with the server's tick 10, and another entity
is replicated with the server's tick 11. This is not a problem if the entities are independent, but if they depend on each other (for example
for client prediction) it could cause issues.

This is especially useful if you have an entity that depends on another entity (e.g. a player and its weapon),
the weapon might have a component `Parent(owner: Entity)` which references the player entity.
In which case we **need** the player entity to be spawned before the weapon entity, otherwise `Parent` component
will reference an entity that does not exist.


## Running the example

To start the server, run `cargo run --example replication_groups server`

Then you can launch multiple clients with the commands:

- `cargo run --example replication_groups client -c 1`

- `cargo run --example replication_groups client -c 2 --client-port 2000`
