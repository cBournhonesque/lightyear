//! This module contains the shared code between the client and the server.
//!
//! The rendering code is here because you might want to run the example in host-server mode, where the server also acts as a client.
//! The simulation logic (movement, etc.) should be shared between client and server to guarantee that there won't be
//! mispredictions/rollbacks.
