# FPS Example

## Features

This example showcases several features that can be useful for building a multiplayer FPS.


#### Prespawning

When you have a player-controlled predicted entity (the predicted `Player` in this example),
it can be useful to be able to spawn objects (here `Bullets`) directly in the predicted timeline.

You can achieve this by having a system that runs both on the client and server and spawns the same entity. The entity should have the `PreSpawnedPlayerObject`. That entity will be spawned 
immediately on the client in the predicted timeline. When the server spawns the entity, it will try replicating it to the client. There will be a matching step where that server entity will try to 
match with a prespawned client entity (using the spawn `Tick` and the entity's `Archetype`). After the matching is done, the bullet becomes a normal `Predicted` entity.

#### Bullet hits

Handling bullet hits can be tricky because the client is in the Predicted timeline but they shoot at enemies that are in the Interpolated timeline (so a bit in the past). There's 2 ways to solve 
this: 
- add Prediction to the target. This is only possible if the enemy movements can be predicted (with extrapolation, or because they move in a deterministic manner). In that case the player and the 
  target are in the same timeline
- use Lag Compensation

Here are a couple resources on lag compensation:
- https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Lag_Compensation
- https://gabrielgambetta.com/lag-compensation.html
  
The idea is that the server will adjust the hit detection by taking into account the interpolation delay of the client to simulate the hit from the point of view of the client. This works by 
storing a history buffer of the past few positions of each enemy so that the hit-detection can rewind those enemies in the past to see if it was a hit.

This can easily be achieved in `lightyear` in combination with `avian` by using the `LagCompensationSpatialQuery`.

In this example, the green enemy on the left is interpolated on the client and hits are detected via lag compensation. The blue enemy on the right is predicted on the client and hits are detected normally.

## Running the example

- Run the server with a gui: `cargo run server`
- Run client with id 1: `cargo run client -c 1`
- Run client with id 2: `cargo run client -c 2`
- Run the client and server in two separate bevy Apps: `cargo run` or `cargo run separate`
- Run the server without a gui: `cargo run --no-default-features --features=server`
- Run the client and server in "HostServer" mode, where the server is also a client (there is only one App): `cargo run host-server`

You can control the behaviour of the example by changing the list of features. By default, all features are enabled (client, server, gui).
For example you can run the server in headless mode (without gui) by running `cargo run --no-default-features --features=server`.
You can modify the file `assets/settings.ron` to modify some networking settings.

### Testing in wasm with webtransport

NOTE: I am using [trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/) to build and serve the wasm example.

You will need a valid SSL certificate to test the example in wasm using webtransport. You will need to run the following
commands:
- `cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" && sh examples/certificates/generate.sh` (to generate the temporary SSL
  certificates, they are only valid for 2 weeks)
- Start the server with: `cargo run -- server`
- Then start the wasm client wasm with `RUSTFLAGS='--cfg getrandom_backend="wasm_js"' trunk serve --features=client`
