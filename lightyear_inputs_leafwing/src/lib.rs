//! # Lightyear Inputs Leafwing
//!
//! This crate provides an integration between `lightyear` and `leafwing-input-manager`.
//!
//! It allows you to use `leafwing-input-manager`'s `ActionState` as the input type for `lightyear`.
//! The inputs are sent from the client to the server and are predicted on the client.
#![no_std]
