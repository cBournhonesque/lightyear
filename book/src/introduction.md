# Introduction

For a quick tutorial about how to use the crate, click [here](./tutorial/title.md).

## What is lightyear?

Lightyear is a networking library for games written in Bevy.
It uses a client-server networking architecture, where the server is authoritative over the game state.

It is heavily inspired by [naia](https://github.com/naia-lib/naia).


## What is this book about?

This book serves several purposes:
- It contains some explanations of game networking concepts, as well as how they are implemented in this crate
- provide some examples of how to use the crate
- explain some of the design decisions that were made

This book does not aim to be a polished document, or a comprehensive reference for lightyear.
It is more of a collection of notes and thoughts that I had while developing the crate. Plus I wanted to have some kind of "wiki"
I could come back to later to remember why I did things a certain way.
