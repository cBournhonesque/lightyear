A library for writing server-authoritative multiplayer games with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).

Heavily inspired by [naia](https://github.com/naia-lib/naia).

*Demo using one server with 2 clients. The entity is predicted (slightly ahead of server) on the controlling client and interpolated (slightly behind server) on the other client.
The server only sends updates to clients 10 times per second but the clients still see smooth updates.*



## Getting started

To quickly get started, you can follow this [tutorial](https://cbournhonesque.github.io/lightyear/book/tutorial/title.html), which re-creates the [simple_box](https://github.com/cBournhonesque/lightyear/tree/main/examples/simple_box) example.

You can also find more information in this WIP [book](https://cbournhonesque.github.io/lightyear/book/).

## Features

### Ergonomic

*Lightyear* provides a simple API for sending and receiving messages, and for replicating entities and components:
- the user needs to define a `Protocol` that defines all the messages, components, inputs that can be sent over the network; as well as the channels
- to send messages, the user mostly only needs to interact with the `Client<P>` and `Server<P>` structs, which provide methods to send messages and send inputs
- all messages are accessible via BevyEvents: `EventReader<MessageEvent<MyMessage>>` or `EventReader<EntitySpawnEvent>`
- for replication, the user just needs to add a `Replicate` component to entities that need to be replicated.

### Batteries-included

- Transport-agnostic: *Lightyear* uses a very general [Transport](https://github.com/cBournhonesque/lightyear/blob/main/lightyear/src/transport/mod.rs) trait to send raw data on the network.
  The trait currently has two implementations:
  - UDP sockets
  - WebTransport (using QUIC): not compatible with wasm yet.
- Serialization
  - *Lightyear* uses [bitcode](https://github.com/SoftbearStudios/bitcode/tree/main) for serialization, which supports very compact serialization. It uses bit-packing (a bool will be serialized as a single bit).
- Message passing
  - *Lightyear* supports sending packets with different guarantees of ordering and reliability through the use of channels.
  - Packet fragmentation (for messages larger than ~1200 bytes) is supported
- Input handling
  - *Lightyear* has special handling for player inputs (mouse presses, keyboards).
    They are buffered every tick on the `Client`, and *lightyear* makes sure that the client input for tick `N` will be also processed on tick `N` on the server.
    Inputs are protected against packet-loss: each packet will contain the client inputs for the last few frames.
  - With the `leafwing` feature, there is a special integration with the [`leafwing-input-manager`](https://github.com/Leafwing-Studios/leafwing-input-manager) crate, where your `leafwing` inputs are networked for you!
- Replication
  - Entities that have the `Replicate` component will be automatically replicated to clients. Only the components that change will be sent over the network. This functionality is similar to what [bevy_replicon](https://github.com/lifescapegame/bevy_replicon) provides.
- Advanced replication
  - **Client-side prediction**: with just a one-line change, you can enable Prediction so that client inputs are immediately applied on the client, and then corrected by the server.
  - **Snapshot interpolation**: with just a one-line change, you can enable Snapshot interpolation so that entities are smoothly interpolated even if replicated infrequently.
  - **Client-authoritative replication**: you can also replicate entities from the client to the server.
  - **Pre-spawning predicted entities**: you can spawn Predicted entities on the client, and then replicate them to the server. This ensures that the entity
    is spawned immediately, but will still be controlled by the server.
  - **Entity mapping**: *lightyear* also supports replicating components/messages that contain references to other entities. The entities will be mapped from the local World to the remove World.
  - **Interest management**: *lightyear* supports replicating only a subset of the World to clients. Interest management is made flexible by the use of `Rooms`
  - **Input Delay**: you can add a custom amount of input-delay as a trade-off between having a more responsive game or more mis-predictions
- Configurable
  - *Lightyear* is highly configurable: you can configure the size of the input buffer, the amount of interpolation-delay, the packet send rate, etc.
    All the configurations are accessible through the `ClientConfig` and `ServerConfig` structs.
- Observability
  - *Lightyear* uses the `tracing` and `metrics` libraries to emit spans and logs around most events (sending/receiving messages, etc.). The metrics
    can be exported to Prometheus for analysis.
- Examples
  - *Lightyear* has plenty of examples demonstrating all these features, as well as the integration with other bevy crates such as `bevy_xpbd_2d`

## Planned features

- Metrics
    - Improve the metrics/logs
- Packet
    - Add support channel bandwidth limiting. If we reach the limit, only replicate priority entities
- Serialization
    - Improve the serialization code to be more ergonomic, and to have fewer copies.
- Correctness: add more unit tests for replication edge-cases

Long-term:
- Delta compression: only send the difference between the current state and the previous state
