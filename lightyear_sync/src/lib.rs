//! # Lightyear Sync
//!
//! This crate provides the synchronization layer for the Lightyear networking library.
//! It handles time synchronization between peers, including:
//! - Ping and RTT estimation (`ping`).
//! - Timeline synchronization to align game state across different peers (`timeline`).
//! - Client and server-specific synchronization logic.
//!
//! The core idea is to allow peers to maintain a synchronized understanding of game time,
//! which is crucial for consistent simulation and prediction.
