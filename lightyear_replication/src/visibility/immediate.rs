/*! Main network visibility module, where you can immediately update the network visibility of an entity for a given client

# Network Visibility

The **network visibility** is used to determine which entities are replicated to a client. The server will only replicate the entities that are relevant to a client. If the client stops being
relevant, the server will despawn that entity for that client. This lets you save bandwidth by only sending the necessary data to each client.


You can update the [`NetworkVisibility`] component of an entity to control its relevance for specific clients.

The visibility is cached, so after you set an entity as `visible` for a client, it will remain relevant
until you change the setting again.

```rust
# use bevy_ecs::entity::Entity;
# use lightyear_replication::prelude::NetworkVisibility;

# let mut client = Entity::from_bits(0x100000000);
let mut visibility = NetworkVisibility::default();
visibility.gain_visibility(client);
visibility.lose_visibility(client);
```
