//! # Lightyear Replication
//!
//! This crate handles the logic for replicating entities and components
//! from the server to clients.
//!
//! It includes systems for:
//! - Tracking changes to components.
//! - Serializing and sending replication messages.
//! - Receiving and applying replication updates on clients.
//! - Managing entity authority and visibility (e.g., interest management, rooms).
//! - Handling component registration for replication.
