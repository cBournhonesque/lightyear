Module to group messages into packets

# Packet
This module defines the concept of a `Packet` which is a byte array that will be sent over the network.
A `Packet` has a maximum size that depends on the transport (around 1400 bytes for UDP), and is
composed of a header and a payload.

The header will compute important information such as the packet sequence number, the packet type, etc.
as well as information to handle the ack system.

The payload is a list of messages that are included in the packet. Messages will be included in the packet
in order of [`Channel`] priority.

Packets that are over the maximum packet size will be fragmented into multiple `FragmentData`.

[`Channel`]: crate::channel::Channel
